If you wish to enable authentication, you must set `CWA_DB_PATH` to point to Calibre-Web's `app.db`, in order to match the username and password.

If logging is enabld, log folder default location is `/var/log/cwa-book-downloader`
Available log levels: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`. Higher levels show fewer messages.

Note that if using TOR, the TZ will be calculated automatically based on IP.

#### Download Settings

| Variable               | Description                                               | Default Value                     |

If you change `BOOK_LANGUAGE`, you can add multiple comma separated languages, such as `en,fr,ru` etc.  

#### AA 

| Variable               | Description                                               | Default Value                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `AA_BASE_URL`          | Base URL of Annas-Archive (could be changed for a proxy)  | `https://annas-archive.org`       |
| `USE_CF_BYPASS`        | Disable CF bypass and use alternative links instead       | `true`                            |
| `FLARESOLVERR_URL`     | Host and port for FlareSolverr active service             | ``                                |
| `FLARESOLVERR_PATH`    | Path of FlareSolverr APIs                                 | `/v1`                             |
| `FLARESOLVERR_TIMEOUT` | Timeout to send to FlareSolverr service (in milliseconds) | `60000`                           |

If you are a donator on AA, you can use your Key in `AA_DONATOR_KEY` to speed up downloads and bypass the wait times.
If disabling the cloudflare bypass, you will be using alternative download hosts, such as libgen or z-lib, but they usually have a delay before getting the more recent books and their collection is not as big as aa's. But this setting should work for the majority of books.
The cloudflare bypass has done using a [FlareSolverr](https://github.com/FlareSolverr/FlareSolverr) service

#### Network Settings

| Variable               | Description                     | Default Value           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `AA_ADDITIONAL_URLS`   | Proxy URLs for AA (, separated) | ``                      |
| `HTTP_PROXY`           | HTTP proxy URL                  | ``                      |
| `HTTPS_PROXY`          | HTTPS proxy URL                 | ``                      |
| `CUSTOM_DNS`           | Custom DNS IP                   | ``                      |
| `USE_DOH`              | Use DNS over HTTPS              | `false`                 |

For proxy configuration, you can specify URLs in the following format:
```bash
# Basic proxy
HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080
HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.example.com:8080

# Proxy with authentication
HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080
HTTPS_PROXY=http://username:password@proxy.example.com:8080
```


The `CUSTOM_DNS` setting supports two formats:

1. **Custom DNS Servers**: A comma-separated list of DNS server IP addresses
   - Example: `127.0.0.53,127.0.1.53` (useful for PiHole)
   - Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in the same string

2. **Preset DNS Providers**: Use one of these predefined options:
   - `google` - Google DNS
   - `quad9` - Quad9 DNS
   - `cloudflare` - Cloudflare DNS
   - `opendns` - OpenDNS

For users experiencing ISP-level website blocks (such as Virgin Media in the UK), using alternative DNS providers like Cloudflare may help bypass these restrictions

If a `CUSTOM_DNS` is specified from the preset providers, you can also set a `USE_DOH=true` to force using DNS over HTTPS,
which might also help in certain network situations. Note that only `google`, `quad9`, `cloudflare` and `opendns` are 
supported for now, and any other value in `CUSTOM_DNS` will make the `USE_DOH` flag ignored.

Try something like this :
```bash
CUSTOM_DNS=cloudflare
USE_DOH=true
```

#### Custom configuration

| Variable               | Description                                                 | Default Value           |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `CUSTOM_SCRIPT`        | Path to an executable script that tuns after each download  | ``                      |

If `CUSTOM_SCRIPT` is set, it will be executed after each successful download but before the file is moved to the ingest directory. This allows for custom processing like format conversion or validation.

The script is called with the full path of the downloaded file as its argument. Important notes:
- The script must preserve the original filename for proper processing
- The file can be modified or even deleted if needed
- The file will be moved to `/cwa-book-ingest` after the script execution (if not deleted)

You can specify these configuration in this format :
```
environment:
  - CUSTOM_SCRIPT=/scripts/process-book.sh

volumes:
  - local/scripts/custom_script.sh:/scripts/process-book.sh
```

### Volume Configuration

```yaml
volumes:
  - /your/local/path:/cwa-book-ingest
  - /cwa/config/path/app.db:/auth/app.db:ro
```
**Note** - If your library volume is on a cifs share, you will get a "database locked" error until you add **nobrl** to your mount line in your fstab file. e.g. //192.168.1.1/Books /media/books cifs credentials=.smbcredentials,uid=1000,gid=1000,iocharset=utf8,**nobrl** - See https://github.com/crocodilestick/Calibre-Web-Automated/issues/64#issuecomment-2712769777

Mount should align with your Calibre-Web-Automated ingest folder.

## 🧅 Tor Variant

This application also offers a variant that routes all its traffic through the Tor network. This can be useful for enhanced privacy or bypassing network restrictions.

To use the Tor variant:

1.  Get the Tor-specific docker-compose file:
    ```bash
    curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/calibrain/calibre-web-automated-book-downloader/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.tor.yml
    ```
2.  Start the service using this file:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.tor.yml up -d
    ```

**Important Considerations for Tor:**

*   **Capabilities:** This variant requires the `NET_ADMIN` and `NET_RAW` Docker capabilities to configure `iptables` for transparent Tor proxying.
*   **Timezone:** When running in Tor mode, the container will attempt to determine the timezone based on the Tor exit node's IP address and set it automatically. This will override the `TZ` environment variable if it is set.
*   **Network Settings:** Custom DNS, DoH, and HTTP(S) proxy settings (`CUSTOM_DNS`, `USE_DOH`, `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`) are ignored when using the Tor variant, as all traffic goes through Tor.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The application consists of a single service:

1. **calibre-web-automated-bookdownloader**: Main application providing web interface and download functionality

## 🏥 Health Monitoring

Built-in health checks monitor:

- Web interface availability
- Download service status
- Cloudflare bypass service connection

Checks run every 30 seconds with a 30-second timeout and 3 retries.
You can enable by adding this to your compose :
```
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=30s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD pyrequests http://localhost:8084/request/api/status || exit 1
```

## 📝 Logging

Logs are available in:

- Container: `/var/logs/cwa-book-downloader.log`
- Docker logs: Access via `docker logs`
